# Acro's Hitboxes G4 v1.0

Acroâ€™s Hitboxes G4 aims to streamline the process of generating knockback and damage from collision.  This addon provides custom nodes that allow the user to apply knockback and damage to an object by changing the trajectory and strength of the knockback, allowing the user to visually see the launch angle and strength to reduce the amount of trial and error from traditional knockback methods, collision shapes, and the color of the hitbox.

# Installation

Copy `addons/acro's_hitbox_g4` into your project (final path should be `res://addons/acro's_hitbox_g4`). Open the Godot Editor, go to **Project Settings > Plugins** and enable the **Acro's Hitbox G4** plugin and click **Update**. You can now add a **Hitbox** node to a scene.

# Variables

## shape (Shape2D)
This variable can affect the collision shape of the hitbox

## color (color)
This variable can modify the color of the collision shape of the hitbox

## debug (bool)
This variable enables a "debug mode" that draws launch angle lines and overrides the "frames active" variables

## destroyable (bool)
This variable determines if the hitbox will be destroyed after a certain number of frames

## hitbox_id (int)
This variable stores a hitbox id

## attack_type (int)
This variable stores what type of attack this hitbox is.  Perfect for ENUMS

## hitbox_priority (int)
This variable stores the hitbox's priority

## frames_active (int)
This variable dictates the amount of frames this hitbox is active.  When the hitbox has been active for a set amount of frames

## damage (int)
This variable stores the amount of damage this hitbox produces

## hit_pause (int)
This variable stores the number of hit pause frames (View Demo Project)

## hit_stun (int)
This variable stores the number of hit pause frames

## block_stun (int)
This variable stores the number of hit pause frames

## angle (int)
This variable stores the launch angle of the hitbox

## base_knockback (float)
This variable stores the base knockback of the hitbox

## knockback_scale (float, range of 0.0 - 1.0)
This variable stores the knockback scale of the hitbox

# Methods

## get_launch_vector (int launch_angle, int strength)
Calculates the launch vector to apply knockback manually (with parameters)
Parameters:
 - **launch_angle**: launch_angle
 - **strength**: length and width of the vector

Returns:
 - Vector to apply knockback
